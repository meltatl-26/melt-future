## Creative Director's Preface

MELT is not an agency. MELT is a proof of concept.

When we took this brief, we started where we always start: with what is actually true. Not what the founder wants to believe. Not what the website says. What the evidence proves.

The evidence is remarkable. Twenty-six years of showing up. Nineteen consecutive NCAA Final Fours. A 22-year Coca-Cola partnership — the kind of tenure that doesn't happen through good pitches, it happens through good execution. A 7-person team that has outproduced agencies ten times its size.

The strategy writes itself: MELT is the agency that actually builds things.

In a category flooding with AI-generated decks and junior strategists who've never managed a single brand ambassador, MELT is staffed by operators. People who have been on-site at 3am negotiating venue contracts. People who have managed 200 staff across 8 cities simultaneously. People who have done it ten thousand times.

Our creative challenge was not to invent a brand. Our challenge was to reveal one that already existed — and make it impossible to ignore.

The brand is the work. The work is the proof. The proof is the brand.

*— Creative Director, Pentagram*

## Part One: Brand Strategy

### 1.1 Brand Story

#### The Narrative Arc

**THE CHALLENGE — Ideas are worthless without delivery**

Every great event starts in a conference room. A brief. A deck. A vision. And then reality arrives — permits in 14 cities, union rules, 200 brand ambassadors who need training by Thursday, a sponsor who just changed the program brief with 11 days to go, a venue that lost power.

Most agencies disappear at this point. They deliver the deck and invoice for strategy.

This is where MELT begins.

**THE TRANSFORMATION — An industry rebuilt around execution**

In 2000, Vince Thompson founded MELT on a conviction that bordered on radical: in experiential marketing, execution is the only thing that matters. Not the idea. Not the deck. The moment the brand touches the consumer — that is the product.

He built MELT differently. Not a team of strategists who hand off to producers. A team of operators — senior-level, production-experienced people who personally manage every activation from concept to close.

Over 26 years, this philosophy compounded. Nineteen Final Fours. A 22-year Coca-Cola partnership. Campaigns with 2,563% ROI and 3,672% influencer returns. A $300M arena deal closed in 90 days.

The thesis held.

**THE RESOLUTION — When AI commoditizes ideas, execution becomes the moat**

We are living through the most significant disruption in marketing history. AI can generate a campaign brief in 30 seconds. It can produce a strategy deck, a creative concept, a social calendar in minutes. Ideas, once scarce, are now infinite.

Execution has never been more valuable.

You cannot prompt-engineer 200 trained brand ambassadors across 8 cities. You cannot AI-generate a permit from Atlanta's special events office. You cannot automate the logistics of a custom Airstream build in a parking lot at 6am.

MELT has built the one thing in marketing that cannot be commoditized: the institutional expertise, the relationships, the scar tissue, and the operational infrastructure to actually deliver world-class brand experiences at scale.

*AI can dream it. We deliver it.*

---

### 1.2 Brand Personality — Archetype System

#### Primary Archetype: The Ruler

*"Power comes from competence, not title."*

The Ruler is marked by mastery. By quiet confidence born of 10,000 activations. The Ruler doesn't pitch — they prove. They don't promise results — they show you the receipt. MELT doesn't sell you on capability, they hand you a ledger.

Evidence in the brand: specific ROI figures (not ranges), named client tenures (22 years, not "long-term"), exact event counts (19 Final Fours, not "many").

#### Secondary Archetype: The Hero

*"Where there's a will, there's a way — and we've done this 10,000 times."*

The Hero is defined by their willingness to take on the hard job. The Hero is the one who shows up when others don't. MELT's "3am venue negotiation" story is a Hero archetype narrative — the work is hard, the conditions are difficult, and MELT is there.

Evidence in the brand: the Execution Iceberg (90% of the work is invisible), the "boots on the ground" language, speed as a value (90 days from concept to $300M contract).

#### Shadow Archetype to Avoid: The Jester

MELT is not playful. MELT is confident, grounded, and decisive. Avoid irony, excessive informality, and self-deprecating humor. Warmth is appropriate; whimsy is not.

#### Human Traits Profile

| Trait | Expression |
|-------|------------|
| **Self-assured** | Never defensive, never overselling |
| **Direct** | Says exactly what they mean, no filler |
| **Battle-tested** | The easy confidence of someone who has genuinely done the hard thing |
| **Specific** | Always concrete, always numerical, always named |
| **Action-oriented** | The next sentence is always "so here's what we do" |

---

### 1.3 Voice and Tone Matrix

MELT's voice is fixed. The tone shifts by context.

#### Voice Dimensions

| Dimension | ← | MELT Position | → | Rationale |
|-----------|---|---------------|---|-----------|
| Serious ←→ Funny | 85% | ● | | The work is serious. Results are serious. Trust is earned through gravity. |
| Formal ←→ Casual | | ● 40% | | Senior peer-to-peer conversation. Not stiff, but never sloppy. |
| Reverent ←→ Irreverent | | | 60% ● | MELT challenges the agency status quo. They call out "deck-deliverers." |
| Enthusiastic ←→ Matter-of-fact | 30% ● | | | MELT's confidence shows in what they don't over-explain. Results speak. |

#### Tone by Context

**Outreach / Sales** *(Homepage, Scoper)*
- **Tone:** Diagnostic, not promotional. Ask the question. Surface the gap.
- **Example:** "Your agency gave you a great deck. Now what?"
- **Avoid:** "We're excited to work with you!" — sounds junior

**Case Studies / Proof**
- **Tone:** Matter-of-fact, almost clinical. The numbers are the drama.
- **Example:** "3,672% influencer ROI. +21.7% dollar sales. 0 incidents on-site."
- **Avoid:** Emotional language around results — let the numbers carry the weight

**About / Founder**
- **Tone:** Direct, first-person, declarative.
- **Example:** "We built this company on one idea: execution is the only thing that matters."
- **Avoid:** "We believe in..." — too soft for operators

**Insights / Thought Leadership**
- **Tone:** Authoritative, contrarian, specific. Challenge assumptions.
- **Example:** "Why your experiential ROI is wrong (and how to fix it)"
- **Avoid:** Listicles, vague "thought leadership," buzzword salads

**Email / Direct Communication**
- **Tone:** Brief, respectful of time, next-step oriented.
- **Example:** "Three things worth your 20 minutes. Call this week?"
- **Avoid:** Long preambles, filler compliments

---

### 1.4 Messaging Hierarchy

#### Tagline *(Top of pyramid — brand essence in one line)*

> **"There are no great ideas without great execution."**

**Strategic rationale:** This is the brand's founding thesis and its competitive positioning compressed into a single sentence. It is not aspirational — it is empirical. It does not claim MELT is the best. It reframes what "best" means. The line works because it is true whether you've heard of MELT or not. It lands with the conviction of a fact, not the desperation of a pitch.

#### Value Proposition

MELT is the execution partner for brands who have ideas — and need them built.
26 years. 10,000+ activations. 7 operators who have personally delivered the work.

*Rationale: This is not a tagline. It is the complete sentence that a prospect should be able to reconstruct after one page of the website. It contains the who (brands who have ideas), the what (built), the proof (26 years, 10K+), and the differentiator (operators, personally).*

#### Key Messages

**1. Small is a feature, not a bug.**
"When you hire MELT, you work with the people who will actually build your activation. Seven operators, zero hand-offs, no layers."

**2. Speed and scale are not competing values.**
"From concept to $300M arena contract in 90 days. Multi-city tours in weeks, not months. We have done this 10,000 times."

**3. Execution is the ROI driver.**
"AI can dream the campaign. Strategy firms can deck it. MELT delivers the experience that generates 2,563% ROI — and proves it with data."

#### Proof Points

| Campaign | Result |
|----------|--------|
| Coca-Cola GameDay | 22-year partnership — one of the longest in independent agency history |
| NCAA Final Four | 19 consecutive years, 2.76M impressions, 39.7M social impressions |
| Comfort Colors (Alabama) | 2,563% ROI, 1M+ impressions, 6,000+ t-shirts |
| Dogsters MLB | 3,672% influencer ROI, +21.7% dollar sales growth |
| Ghirardelli | 93.1% brand consideration lift, $766K earned media, 771% influencer ROI |
| City of Mobile Arena | $300M deal, 90 days concept-to-contract |
| Bath & Body Works | 16 cities, 8 weeks, 560% ROI, $1.5M budget |

#### Conversation Starters

| Buyer State | Hook |
|-------------|------|
| Overwhelmed marketing director | "You've got 50 AI-generated campaign ideas. Who's building them?" |
| Frustrated brand manager | "Your agency gave you a great deck. Now what?" |
| VP who needs proof | "We've produced this event 19 times. Here's what year 20 looks like." |
| New to experiential | "Digital reaches screens. Experiential reaches people. Here's the math." |

## Part Two: Visual Identity System

### 2.1 Logo Concept — Three Strategic Directions

#### Direction A: The Molten Wordmark *(Recommended)*

**Concept:** MELT rendered in Industry Ultra/Black, compressed and modified so letterforms appear to be mid-melt — not dripping or distorted (cliché), but dense. The letterforms are tight, touching, compressed. M and E are kerned so they share a stroke. The word looks like it is under pressure.

**Strategic rationale:** The name "MELT" is a gift. Most brands fight their name to establish seriousness. MELT's name is its thesis — the transformation point between solid (an idea) and liquid (execution). The wordmark should contain the metaphor without illustrating it literally. Compression = pressure = force = execution.

**Execution specs:**
- Typeface base: Industry Ultra (via TypeKit `clv7xin`)
- Weight: Ultra (900) — the heaviest cut — this is a heavy business
- Letter-spacing: `-0.04em` (tighter than default, creates density)
- Case: ALL CAPS — always
- Customization: Modify the E so its crossbar extends into the L, creating a ligature that suggests continuity/flow without being decorative
- Color (primary): White reversed on Navy or Black
- Color (on light backgrounds): Navy `#0A0A6B` or Black `#000000`

**Logo lockup variations:**
- Wordmark alone (horizontal): `MELT`
- Wordmark + descriptor: `MELT` / `EXPERIENTIAL MARKETING` (stacked, Satoshi Light, 0.15em tracking)
- Wordmark + city: `MELT ATLANTA` (same treatment, slightly lighter descriptor)

---

#### Direction B: The Activation Mark *(Symbol Approach)*

**Concept:** An abstract mark derived from the physics of a melt point — a geometric shape caught in the moment of transformation. Specifically: a perfect square with one corner that has begun to resolve into a curve. The square represents structure, precision, and the built world. The single curved corner is the moment of change, of activation, of a brand coming alive.

**Strategic rationale:** MELT's business is transforming a static brief into a living experience. The mark captures this precisely — not fully solid (rigid/corporate), not fully liquid (loose/unconstrained), but in transformation. The asymmetry of a single curved corner makes the mark feel directional: always moving forward.

**Execution specs:**
- Constructed on a 100×100 unit grid
- Outer dimensions: 84×84 units, centered in frame
- Three corners: sharp (0 radius)
- One corner (bottom-right): radius 28 units
- Stroke: None — pure filled form
- Color: Navy `#0A0A6B`, Lime Green `#D4FF00`, or White (for reversed applications)

---

#### Direction C: The Operator Mark *(Combination Approach)*

**Concept:** An uppercase M constructed from four angled strokes that read simultaneously as a letterform and as a schematic — like the aerial view of an event floor plan, or like the cross-section of an activation build. The M is geometric, modular, and precise.

**Strategic rationale:** The operator identity is MELT's deepest truth. These are the people who build things. The mark should read like something that was constructed, not drawn. Grid-based, structural, with no organic curves. The mark communicates that MELT operates in the built environment — stages, custom fabrications, pop-up structures.

**Execution specs:**
- Constructed on 12-column grid (same grid system as the website)
- M built from four rectangular blocks with 45° angled connections
- Weight: Heavy — the mark should occupy its space completely
- Works as: app icon, embossed stamp, embroidery patch
- Color: Navy on Lime Green background (primary), White on Black (reversed)

---

### 2.2 Logo Variations

| Variant | Wordmark Color | Background | Use |
|---------|---------------|------------|-----|
| **Primary (dark bg)** | White, Industry Ultra | Navy `#0A0A6B` or Black | Website header, event signage, pitch deck |
| **Primary (light bg)** | Navy `#0A0A6B`, Industry Ultra | White or Off-White | Business documents, letterhead |
| **Secondary** | Single color, no descriptor | Any approved bg | Email signatures, stamps |
| **Monochrome Black** | `#000000` | — | Letterhead, legal documents |
| **Monochrome White (Reversed)** | `#FFFFFF` | — | Dark photography, Navy bg, swag |

**Minimum Size Specifications:**
- Digital: 80px wide (wordmark), 32px (symbol mark)
- Print: 25mm wide (wordmark), 10mm (symbol mark)
- At minimum size: Drop descriptor, use wordmark only
- Below minimum: Use symbol mark only

**Clear Space Requirements:**
- All sides: Minimum 1× cap-height of the "M" in the wordmark
- On busy photographic backgrounds (digital only): `box-shadow: drop-shadow(0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.4))`

---

### 2.3 Logo Usage Rules

#### Correct Applications

1. **White wordmark on Navy** — The flagship. Use at all primary touchpoints: website header, pitch deck cover, event signage.
2. **Navy wordmark on white/off-white** — Business documents, letterhead, stationery. Clean, authoritative.
3. **White wordmark on full-bleed photography** — Event photography, case study headers. Ensure sufficient contrast or add the approved dark overlay.
4. **Lime Green wordmark on Black** — High-impact digital applications, social media, presentations. The activation color. Use sparingly for maximum impact.
5. **White symbol mark on any approved brand color** — App icons, profile avatars, embossed applications, merchandise.

#### Incorrect Applications

1. **Never** stretch, distort, or scale non-proportionally
2. **Never** apply gradients, drop shadows (except the specified photography treatment), or effects to the logo
3. **Never** use the logo on backgrounds that create insufficient contrast — logo must pass WCAG AA 4.5:1 ratio
4. **Never** use outline/stroke versions of the wordmark — the logo is always filled
5. **Never** use the wordmark with any color other than White, Navy, Black, or Lime Green

---

### 2.4 Color Palette

**Strategic Framing**

The color system is built around a single insight: MELT operates at the intersection of the built world and the activated world. The palette is grounded (Navy, Black) and electrified (Lime, Cyan). The combination is not accidental — it is the visual equivalent of the brand's core idea: the moment a structure comes alive.

---

#### Primary Colors

**01 — Navy** *"The structure before the activation"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. White |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|----------------|
| `#0A0A6B` | PMS 2755 C | 90, 85, 0, 58 | 10, 10, 107 | 240°, 83%, 23% | 14.1:1 — AAA |

Dominant dark background color. The brand's gravity. Use for: dark section backgrounds, text on light, the "before" state.

*Psychology: Authority, depth, permanence. Brands that matter use dark backgrounds. Navy says "we have been here before you arrived."*

---

**02 — Lime Green** *"The activation signal"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. Navy | WCAG vs. Black |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|---------------|----------------|
| `#D4FF00` | PMS 389 C | 17, 0, 100, 0 | 212, 255, 0 | 79°, 100%, 50% | 10.8:1 — AAA | 14.7:1 — AAA |

Primary CTA and action color. All primary buttons, progress indicators, scrollbar, hover states, focus rings. The "signal" color.

*Psychology: Electric, urgent, alive. Not a natural green — too pure, too charged. The color of a scoreboard, a "live" indicator, a circuit completing. It says "this is happening now."*

**Usage rules:** Only use for CTAs, highlights, focus indicators, the scrollbar. Never as a section background fill. Never as decorative area color.

---

**03 — Royal Blue** *"The connector"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. White |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|----------------|
| `#3356FF` | PMS 2728 C | 80, 67, 0, 0 | 51, 86, 255 | 229°, 100%, 60% | 3.2:1 — AA (large) |

Secondary accent. The ContactCTA section background, service accents, active states, interactive elements.

*Psychology: Trust, intelligence, velocity. Where Navy is gravitas, Royal Blue is movement. It's the color of a brand that's been vetted — the blue of institutional relationships.*

---

#### Secondary Colors

**04 — Yellow** *"The highlight"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. Navy |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| `#FFD600` | PMS 012 C | 0, 14, 100, 0 | 255, 214, 0 | 50°, 100%, 50% | 9.6:1 — AAA |

Secondary accent for sports/culinary contexts. Service accent for Retail & Promotions. Eyebrow labels on dark sections.

*Psychology: Warmth, energy, consumer goods. This is the CPG yellow — the Coca-Cola, the ESPN, the game-day energy. It roots MELT in the consumer marketing world.*

---

**05 — Golden Yellow** *"The prestige marker"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. Navy |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| `#F4B942` | PMS 7549 C | 0, 24, 73, 4 | 244, 185, 66 | 40°, 89%, 61% | 7.5:1 — AAA |

Eyebrow text labels, award references, stat display numbers on dark sections.

*Psychology: Achievement, longevity, earned status. Not the sharp yellow of consumer energy — the amber of aged authority. "26 years" deserves gold.*

---

**06 — Coral** *"The human moment"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. Navy |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| `#FF4040` | PMS 485 C | 0, 75, 75, 0 | 255, 64, 64 | 0°, 100%, 63% | 4.8:1 — AA |

Service accent for College & NIL. Alert states, error states, testimonial quotation marks.

*Psychology: Urgency, passion, youth. The coral is the crowd moment — the celebration frame, the viral clip. It's the color of a human face lit by stage lights.*

---

**07 — Cyan** *"The intelligence layer"*

| Hex | Pantone | CMYK | RGB | HSL | WCAG vs. Navy |
|-----|---------|------|-----|-----|---------------|
| `#00F0FF` | PMS 3105 C | 100, 0, 0, 0 | 0, 240, 255 | 184°, 100%, 50% | 11.4:1 — AAA |

Service accent for Sponsorship. Logo hover states on white backgrounds. Technology/data visualization accent.

*Psychology: Precision, technology, intelligence. Used sparingly — the color of a heat map, a data overlay, an "insight" moment.*

---

#### Neutral Colors

| Name | Hex | Use |
|------|-----|-----|
| **Black** | `#000000` | Header backgrounds, maximum contrast elements |
| **Gray-900** | `#1A1A1A` | Body text on light backgrounds |
| **Gray-300** | `#949292` | Secondary text, captions, descriptors on dark backgrounds |
| **Gray-100** | `#E8E8EA` | Dividers, borders, form fields |
| **Off-White** | `#F5F5F7` | Alternate light background (slightly cooler than white) |
| **White** | `#FFFFFF` | Primary light background, reversed text |

---

#### Semantic / Functional Colors

| Role | Foreground | Background | Border |
|------|-----------|------------|--------|
| Success | `#2E7D32` | `#E8F5E9` | `#C8E6C9` |
| Error | `#C62828` | `#FFEBEE` | `#FFCDD2` |
| Warning | `#FFD600` | — | — |
| Info | `#3356FF` | — | — |

---

#### Service Color System

Each of MELT's 6 core services owns a color from the palette:

| # | Service | Color | Hex |
|---|---------|-------|-----|
| 01 | Experiential Event Marketing | Lime Green | `#D4FF00` |
| 02 | Social Content & Influencer | Golden Yellow | `#F4B942` |
| 03 | Sports, Music & Culinary | Royal Blue | `#3356FF` |
| 04 | Retail & National Promotions | Yellow | `#FFD600` |
| 05 | College & NIL Marketing | Coral | `#FF4040` |
| 06 | Sponsorship Strategy | Cyan | `#00F0FF` |

---

#### Dark Mode Philosophy

MELT is dark-first. Navy/black is the default canvas. Off-white sections (`#F5F5F7`) provide contrast rhythm — proof moments that interrupt the dark narrative with evidence. There is no separate dark mode: **darkness IS the mode.**

Section color rhythm:
- **Dark (navy + grain):** Authority sections — hero, services, stats, testimonials, footer
- **Light (off-white):** Proof sections — featured work, client logos, team
- **Royal Blue:** The single CTA moment — contact us. One per page.

---

### 2.5 Typography

#### Primary Typeface: Industry *(Bold/Ultra)*

*Character, weight, presence.*

**Source:** Adobe TypeKit — `https://use.typekit.net/clv7xin.css`

Industry is drawn from industrial lettering traditions — the kind of letterforms you'd find on a machine housing or a stadium scoreboard. It is legible at distance, massive at scale, and completely neutral when it comes to pretension. It doesn't aestheticize. It declares.

**CSS variable:** `--font-headline: 'industry', sans-serif`

| Weight | Value | Use |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Ultra | 900 | Logo wordmark, hero display, the word "EXECUTION" — reserved for moments that must dominate |
| Bold | 700 | All h1–h3 headlines, navigation labels, section titles, stat numbers |
| Demi | 600 | h4, eyebrow labels when large-format |
| Light Italic | 300i | Contrast emphasis within headlines — the italic cut in Light creates cinematic tension against Bold |

**Letter-spacing rules:**

| Context | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Display/hero | `-0.02em` to `-0.03em` |
| Headlines (h1–h3) | `-0.02em` |
| Navigation | `+0.08em` |
| Eyebrows (uppercase labels) | `+0.15em` |

---

#### Secondary Typeface: Satoshi *(Regular/Medium)*

*Clarity, humanity, legibility.*

**Source:** Fontshare CDN — `https://api.fontshare.com/v2/css?f[]=satoshi@300,400,500,700&display=swap`

Where Industry says "we have been building this since before your company existed," Satoshi says "and we can explain it in plain language."

**CSS variable:** `--font-body: 'Satoshi', sans-serif`

| Weight | Value | Use |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Regular | 400 | All body copy, paragraph text, article text, form inputs |
| Medium | 500 | UI labels, form field labels, button text, sub-navigation |
| Bold | 700 | Pull quotes, body-text emphasis, data labels |
| Light | 300 | Captions, legal text, form helper text, fine print |

**Line-height rules:**

| Context | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Body copy | 1.6 |
| Captions | 1.5 |
| Testimonials/pull quotes | 1.4 |

---

#### Fluid Type Scale *(CSS Clamp — scales with viewport)*

All sizes are responsive via `clamp()`. No breakpoint overrides needed for typography.

| Token | CSS Value | Min → Max | Use |
|-------|-----------|-----------|-----|
| `--display-hero` | `clamp(4rem, 12vw, 8rem)` | 64px → 128px | Hero section h1 |
| `--display-massive` | `clamp(3rem, 10vw, 6.5rem)` | 48px → 104px | Campaign-style headings |
| `--display-section` | `clamp(2.5rem, 8vw, 5rem)` | 40px → 80px | Section title moments |
| `--h1` | `clamp(2.5rem, 5vw + 1rem, 5rem)` | 40px → 80px | Standard page titles |
| `--h2` | `clamp(2rem, 3.5vw + 0.5rem, 3.5rem)` | 32px → 56px | Section headings |
| `--h3` | `clamp(1.5rem, 2vw + 0.5rem, 2.25rem)` | 24px → 36px | Sub-sections |
| `--h4` | `clamp(1.25rem, 1vw + 0.75rem, 1.5rem)` | 20px → 24px | Cards, list headers |
| `--body-lg` | `clamp(1.125rem, 0.5vw + 1rem, 1.375rem)` | 18px → 22px | Lead paragraphs |
| `--body` | `clamp(1rem, 0.5vw + 0.875rem, 1.125rem)` | 16px → 18px | Standard body copy |
| `--caption` | `clamp(0.75rem, 0.25vw + 0.7rem, 0.875rem)` | 12px → 14px | Image captions, legal |
| `--eyebrow` | `clamp(0.6875rem, 0.125vw + 0.65rem, 0.75rem)` | 11px → 12px | Section labels |
| `--stat-number` | `clamp(3rem, 4vw + 1.5rem, 4.5rem)` | 48px → 72px | Proof statistics |

- Captions: never below 12px
- Navigation: never below 14px
- Button labels: 14px minimum

#### Font Pairing Strategy

Industry provides the visual authority and brand identity; Satoshi handles clarity and readability. **Never mix them at the same hierarchy level** — Industry for headings and UI labels, Satoshi for body copy. The contrast between their personalities is intentional: one built, one written.

### 2.6 Imagery Style

#### Photography Philosophy: "The Proof Shot"

Every photograph in the MELT system is a proof point. The photography doesn't style the brand — it documents what the brand does. The photographic style should feel like premium production stills from the world's best events: the stadium looks packed, the build looks flawless, the crowd is genuinely engaged, the brand moment is unmistakable.

**This is not lifestyle photography. This is achievement photography.**

---

#### Photography Categories

**01 — The Scale Shot**
- *What it shows:* The full environment — a stadium, a tent structure, a multi-city tour stop from above
- *Direction:* Wide angle, golden hour or stadium lighting preferred. Show the scope. Make the client feel the ambition.
- *Portfolio example:* The Final Four activation looking out over the arena floor

**02 — The Brand Moment**
- *What it shows:* The consumer touching the brand — hand on a product, face in the photo booth, eyes on the screen
- *Direction:* Intimate but not posed. Shot at eye level. The brand should be unmistakable in frame.
- *Portfolio example:* Ghirardelli sampling table with consumer engagement

**03 — The Build Shot**
- *What it shows:* The fabricated structure — the custom Airstream, the pop-up store, the stage
- *Direction:* Architectural. Clean angles, controlled lighting. This is the craft photo — the evidence of execution.
- *Portfolio example:* Bath & Body Works basketball pop-up structure

**04 — The Energy Shot**
- *What it shows:* Crowd energy at peak — hands up, faces lit, the moment of maximum activation
- *Direction:* Motion blur acceptable and encouraged. Shot at crowd level. Raw and real.
- *Portfolio example:* NCAA Final Four crowd moments

**05 — The Data Portrait**
- *What it shows:* A single person or small group in a brand ambassador context — uniformed, engaged, professional
- *Direction:* Natural light preferred. The person should look like a professional, not a stock model.

#### Photography Technical Specifications

| Format | Primary | Fallback |
|--------|---------|---------|
| Web | WebP | JPEG |

| Use | Max Width |
|-----|-----------|
| Hero | 1920px |
| Gallery | 1600px |
| Thumbnail | 800px |

**Aspect ratios:** 16:9 for hero/landscape events | 4:5 for social/mobile | 1:1 for grid cards

**Client logo treatment:** `filter: brightness(0) invert(1)` — all client logos appear white on dark backgrounds at 0.6 opacity, 1.0 on hover

---

#### Iconography Style

All icons use the **Lucide React** library with consistent specifications:
- Stroke width: `1.5` — never filled icons
- Sizes: 20px (UI), 24px (feature callouts), 32px (service category markers)
- Color: inherits from parent — white on dark, Navy on light
- Philosophy: **Icons clarify, never decorate.** Every icon must be paired with a text label.

---

#### Graphic Elements

**Grain Texture**

Applied as an SVG fractalNoise filter at 0.03 opacity over dark section backgrounds. The grain adds materiality — it suggests texture, craft, the physical world. It prevents the Navy/Black from reading as purely digital.

```css
/* CSS implementation */
.grain::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
  /* feTurbulence type="fractalNoise" baseFrequency="0.65" numOctaves="3" */
  mix-blend-mode: overlay;
  opacity: 0.03;
  pointer-events: none;
}
```

- feTurbulence: `type="fractalNoise"` `baseFrequency="0.65"` `numOctaves="3"`
- Blend mode: `overlay`
- Opacity: `0.03`
- Apply to: Dark (navy/black) sections only — never light sections

**12-Column Grid**

All layouts use a consistent 12-column grid system. The grid is asymmetric in application — cards span different columns, elements overlap — but the underlying structure is rigorous. This mirrors MELT's actual operating style: disciplined process in service of dynamic outcomes.

## Part Three: Brand Applications

### 3.1 Business Card

**Front**

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Black `#000000` or Navy `#0A0A6B` |
| Logo | White wordmark, centered vertically, left-aligned |
| Tagline (optional) | Satoshi Light, 8pt, Gray-300 `#949292`, flush left below logo |
| Production | Soft-touch matte laminate, portrait orientation 85×55mm, 650gsm |

**Back**

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Lime Green `#D4FF00` |
| Name | Industry Bold, 14pt, Navy `#0A0A6B`, ALL CAPS |
| Title | Satoshi Medium, 9pt, Navy, mixed case |
| Contact block | Email, phone, website — Satoshi Regular, 8pt, Navy |
| City | `ATLANTA, GA` — Industry Demi, 7pt, 0.15em tracking, Navy |
| Optional | 1px horizontal rule, Navy, full width |

**Strategic Rationale**

The two-sided system creates a reveal experience — the brand's gravity (black front) and its energy (lime green back). The lime green back is designed to be face-up on a desk: when you flip the card, you encounter MELT's operational identity. The executive's name in Navy on Lime reads as: "MELT makes things happen, and this is the person who makes them happen."

---

### 3.2 Letterhead and Stationery

**Letterhead (8.5×11")**

*Header zone (top 1.25"):*
- White background
- Navy wordmark, left-aligned at 1" margin
- 1px full-width Lime Green `#D4FF00` rule below header zone

*Body zone:*
- Off-white `#F5F5F7` or white — standard business paper (90gsm)
- Satoshi Regular, 10/15pt for body copy
- 1" margins all sides
- Page number: Navy, Satoshi Regular, 8pt, right-aligned

*Footer zone (bottom 0.75"):*
- Light Gray `#E8E8EA` rule, full width
- `MELT | meltatl.com | hello@meltatl.com | (404) 585-3718 | Atlanta, GA`
- Satoshi Regular, 7pt, Gray-300, centered

**Envelope (#10)**
- Navy background
- White wordmark and return address, Satoshi Regular 8pt
- The envelope announces the brand before the letter is opened

---

### 3.3 Email Signature

```
[MELT Logo — 80px wide, white, linked to meltatl.com]

FIRST LAST                         ← Industry Bold, 13px, Navy #0A0A6B
Title                              ← Satoshi Regular, 11px, Gray-300 #949292

hello@meltatl.com                  ← Satoshi Regular, 11px, Gray-900 #1A1A1A
(404) 585-3718
meltatl.com
Atlanta, Georgia

────────────────────────────────── ← 1px Lime Green #D4FF00 rule

There are no great ideas without   ← Satoshi Light Italic, 10px, Gray-300
great execution.
```

*Specification:* White background. The Lime Green rule is a micro-branded moment: small enough to be tasteful, bright enough to create brand recognition. Every email MELT sends ends with the positioning statement.

---

### 3.4 Social Media Templates

**Profile Avatar (All Platforms)**
- Design: White `MELT` wordmark on Navy or Black square
- Alternate: The Activation Mark (Direction B symbol) on Lime Green
- Dimensions: 400×400px
- Format: PNG, no transparency on primary color background

**Platform-Specific Designs:**

| Platform | Dimensions | Design |
|----------|------------|--------|
| **LinkedIn** | 1584×396px | Navy + grain. Left: wordmark + "Atlanta's Execution Agency." Right: "10,000+ Activations. 26 Years." over photography. Bottom: 12px Lime Green strip. |
| **Instagram** | 1080×566px | Black background. White wordmark centered. "experiential marketing • atlanta" in Satoshi Light, Gray-300. Every 3rd post is a stat/quote. |
| **Twitter/X** | 1500×500px | Full-bleed event photography, 60% opacity. White wordmark + tagline, left-justified. Yellow 4px bottom rule. |
| **Facebook** | 851×315px | Dark navy gradient. Wordmark left, tagline right. Contact in Gray-300, bottom. |
| **YouTube** | 2560×1440px | Black background. Wordmark in safe zone (1546×423px). Tagline below in Satoshi Light. Corner: Lime Green Activation Mark. |

---

### 3.5 Presentation Template

**Slide System (16:9, 1920×1080)**

**Title Slide** *(Campaign Presentation Cover)*
- Full-bleed photography at 70% opacity over Navy overlay
- Top: White MELT wordmark, 40px, left-aligned at 80px margin
- Center-bottom: Campaign/project title, Industry Ultra, White, 72px, ALL CAPS
- Below title: Lime Green rule, 2px, 400px wide, left-aligned
- Below rule: Client name + Date, Satoshi Regular, White, 20px
- Bottom-right: The Activation Mark in Lime Green, 60px

**Content Slide** *(The Proof Slide)*
- White background
- Navy wordmark top-left, 24px
- Section header: Industry Bold, Navy, 36px, flush left
- Body: Satoshi Regular, Gray-900, 18px, 680px wide column
- Accent column (right): Lime Green background zone, 320px wide — for stats, callouts
- Stat format in accent column: Industry Ultra, Navy, 64px (number) + Satoshi Regular, 16px (label)

**Data Slide** *(Proof Points / ROI)*
- Black background, grain texture
- Title: Industry Bold, White, 36px
- Data cards (3–4 cards): Royal Blue left border 4px, White metric Industry Ultra 48px, Gray-300 label below in Satoshi Regular 14px
- Source note: Bottom-right, Satoshi Regular, 10px, Gray-300

**Closing Slide**
- Background: Lime Green `#D4FF00`, full bleed
- Center: `LET'S BUILD SOMETHING REAL.` — Industry Ultra, Navy, 72px, ALL CAPS
- Below: Contact info, Satoshi Regular, Navy, 20px
- Bottom-right: White MELT wordmark, 40px

*Rationale: The closing slide breaks pattern intentionally — every other slide has been on dark or white. The Lime Green ending is a "signal received" moment. The brand's action color takes over when it's time to respond.*

## Part Five: Strategic Rationale Summary

Every decision in this system derives from one insight:

**MELT's competitive advantage is invisible to the untrained eye — and this brand makes it impossible to ignore.**

The name. The colors. The typography. The photography. The copy. All of it is doing one job: translating the experience of working with 7 world-class operators over 26 years into a brand you can trust before the first call.

- The Navy says: we have been here a long time and we are still here.
- The Lime Green says: and when it's time to move, we move.
- Industry Ultra says: this is not an agency that hedges.
- Satoshi says: but we can explain everything in plain language.
- The tagline says: your idea is not the product. The execution is.

This is the brand of an agency that has earned its authority — and knows it.

## Part Six: Web Design System

*This section bridges the brand identity to the living codebase — `melt-future/site-next/` (Next.js 16, React 19, TypeScript 5, Tailwind CSS 4).*

#### Media Components

**Image Container**
- Aspect ratio variants: `16/9`, `3/2`, `4/3`, `1/1`
- `object-fit: cover; object-position: center`
- `border-radius: var(--radius-sm)` (12px) on cards
- `overflow: hidden` on container

**Image Reveal** *(Scroll-triggered)*
- `clip-path: inset(100% 0 0 0)` → `inset(0 0 0 0)` as element enters viewport
- `transform: scale(1.1)` → `scale(1)` simultaneously
- Duration: `1s` | Easing: `--ease-out-expo` | Trigger: `ScrollTrigger`, `start: "top 80%"`

**Video Embed**
- Native HTML5 `<video>` with custom controls overlay
- Poster image shown before play
- Ambient/hero video: `muted autoplay loop playsInline`

---

#### Layout Components

**Section**
- Always add `data-section-theme="dark"` or `"light"` — enables header transparency detection
- Apply `.grain` class for dark sections (adds `::after` texture overlay)
- *Do NOT omit this attribute — it breaks the transparent header color-swap behavior*

**Container**
- `max-width: var(--container)` (1280px) | `margin: 0 auto` | `padding: 0 var(--gutter)`
- `.container-wide`: `max-width: var(--container-wide)` (1440px)

### 6.3 Page Templates and Patterns

#### Homepage Section Sequence

```
1. Hero (LetterboxScroll / full-screen)          ← dark, navy, animated
2. ServicesWheel                                  ← dark, navy
3. Stats Bar                                      ← dark, navy + grain
4. Featured Work Grid                             ← LIGHT, off-white
5. Why MELT (icon grid + copy)                   ← LIGHT, off-white
6. Client Logos (marquee)                         ← LIGHT, off-white
7. Testimonials (carousel)                        ← dark, navy + grain
8. Contact CTA                                    ← ROYAL BLUE (unique)
9. Footer                                         ← dark, navy
```

*Pattern: dark → light → dark → blue creates persuasion rhythm. Royal blue appears once — the action moment.*

#### Case Study Template

```
1. Hero image (full-bleed) + project metadata strip
2. Narrative overview (dark section)
3. Image gallery (lightbox-enabled, grid)
4. Key outcome stats (dark, golden-yellow numbers)
5. Related work grid (3 cards)
```

#### Contact Page Template

```
Layout: Two-column, 60/40 split
  Left (60%):  Contact form (name, email, company, phone, project type, message)
  Right (40%): Info block (email, phone, location) + Project Scoper CTA

Mobile: Single column, form first
```

#### Empty States

| Context | Message | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| Work filter — no results | "No projects match this filter" | "Clear filters" button |
| Form loading | Skeleton screen on Scoper results | — |
| 404 | Branded error page | "Go home" CTA |

### 6.4 Developer Implementation Guide

#### Token Setup

```css
/* Root layout — already configured in src/app/layout.tsx */
@import "@/styles/shared/globals.css";    /* All CSS custom properties */
@import "@/styles/shared/typography.css"; /* Type scale classes */
```

#### Correct Token Usage

```css
/* ✅ Correct — use tokens */
.component {
  color: var(--text-inverse);
  background: var(--navy);
  font-size: var(--body);
  padding: var(--space-md);
  border-radius: var(--radius-sm);
}

/* ❌ Wrong — hardcoding instead of tokens */
.component {
  color: #ffffff;
  background: #0A0A6B;
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding: 24px;
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

#### Section Theming (Required on Every Section)

```jsx
// ✅ Every <section> must have data-section-theme
<section className="my-section" data-section-theme="dark">
  {/* Header IntersectionObserver reads this attribute */}
</section>

<section className="my-section" data-section-theme="light">
  {/* Triggers header to switch to inverted (dark text) state */}
</section>
```

#### Animation Pattern

```javascript
import { gsap } from 'gsap';
import { ScrollTrigger } from 'gsap/ScrollTrigger';
import { useReducedMotion } from '@/hooks/useReducedMotion';

// ✅ Always check reduced motion first
const prefersReduced = useReducedMotion();

if (!prefersReduced) {
  gsap.from(element, {
    opacity: 0,
    y: 40,
    duration: 0.8,
    ease: 'cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.04, 1)'  // --ease-custom
  });
}
// Static fallback: element already visible in its final state
```

#### GSAP Custom Ease (Brand Standard)

```javascript
// The brand's signature easing — used everywhere
const brandEase = 'cubic-bezier(0.42, 0, 0.04, 1)';

// In CSS: var(--ease-custom)
// In GSAP config: { ease: 'power2.inOut' } is the closest preset
// Prefer the cubic-bezier value for precision
```

#### Known Token Inconsistencies *(follow-up cleanup task)*

These issues exist in the codebase and should be resolved separately:

| Issue | Location | Fix |
|-------|---------|-----|
| `--space-4xl` not in globals.css | Used with fallback `200px` in page CSS | Add `--space-4xl: 200px` to globals.css |
| `--color-navy`, `--color-royal-blue`, `--color-gray-*` not defined | `about.css`, `contact.css`, `work.css`, `awards.css` | Replace with short-form tokens (`--navy`, `--royal-blue`, etc.) |
| Form success/error colors hardcoded | `contact.css` | Replace with `--success` / `--error` semantic tokens |

## Addendum: Shadow Board Critique

*6.8/10 — Conditional Yes*

The foundation is strong. The risks are concentrated and fixable. Five specific wounds to close before this brand is bulletproof:

**1. Kill the AI line.**
"AI can dream it. We deliver it." is temporally brittle — it will date in 18 months when AI can execute, too. Replace with a timeless claim: *"The brief is never the hard part. The build is."*

**2. Name a second operator.**
Vince IS the brand right now. That's a single point of failure the brand doesn't acknowledge. Name one more person — a COO, a senior producer — to distribute the credibility and signal organizational depth.

**3. Pick one design personality.**
The two website expressions (Capes / Handcrafted) are both excellent. Let conversion data decide, not creative preference. A/B test for 60 days. Deprecate the underperformer. One brand needs one voice.

**4. Reframe "7 people."**
Enterprise procurement will flag the headcount. Replace the number with the experience: *"Every campaign led by the same senior operator from brief to close."* Same truth, no alarm.

**5. Build the playbook.**
The institutional knowledge in Vince's head — 26 years of permit relationships, vendor contacts, activation frameworks — is IP. Document it. It's succession planning. It's proof the moat is real. It becomes a sellable asset if MELT ever raises or exits.
